ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Saad Khalid Abbasi, and I am an enthusiastic and dedicated entry-level data scientist with a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I recently graduated with a Bachelor in Computer Science from Virtual University of Pakistan, where I developed a passion for uncovering insights from data and solving complex problems.

ðŸ’» During my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience with various data science tools and technologies such as Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. I have also completed several projects that involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization, which have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills.

As a fresh data scientist, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and contribute to innovative data-driven solutions. I am particularly interested in leveraging data to drive decision-making, optimize processes, and improve outcomes in various domains.

ðŸš€ I am excited to embark on this journey and look forward to collaborating with experienced professionals and continuously learning and growing in the field of data science.
